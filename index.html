        <h2>Ingredients You Need</h2>

        <p>

            The secret to incredibly juicy burger patties is the addition of crushed crackers or panko
            breadcrumbs to
            hold in the natural fat and juices.

            We definitely recommend using crackers if you have them. Adding crushed crackers is an old-school method
            to
            add more flavor than plain breadcrumbs. Plus, it’s super handy for using up that package of crackers
            you’ve
            had sitting in the pantry for weeks.

            Here is everything you need to make the best homemade hamburger patties:


        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Ground chuck:-We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
            <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs:–The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be
                gluten-free!)</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce:–Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
            <li>Egg:–To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
            <li>Milk:–The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Seasonings:-Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
        </ol>
